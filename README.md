# forest_land_analytics
Analyze the change in the forest land of countries and compare it with the agricultural land of the same country.There are two files in this repository out of which forest_growth_over_the_years.py plots the countries with the maximum change of rate of forest land either positive or negative. The other file, forests vs agriculture land.py tells us the relationship between the change in agricultural land and forest land. I decided to plot this as I wanted to statistically know if want for agricultural land is a major reason for deforestation. Also, all programs here use iso alpha 3 country codes. In forest_growth_over_the_years.py execution, we see that the plots have these country codes in them whereas in forests vs agriculture land.py you have to input your country's code to see the ratio of the agricultural land and forest land. So, you can have a look at the country codes here in this link: https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm.
